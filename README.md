## Hello!

I'm a current sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Chicago, excited about software engineering üòÅ. 

‚ùó Projects ‚ùó:
** Please see under repositories the project I've worked on my Summer 2024 (freshman summer) internship, which is about training an LSTM model with stock price data, and visualizing. 

** The code for my "Intro to Programming II" course project is available upon request. I can't share it on Github publicly because it is basically answers to a homework that might get asssigned in class again :).
