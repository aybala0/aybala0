## Hello!

I'm a current sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Chicago, excited about software engineering üòÅ. 

‚ùó Projects ‚ùó

** Please see under repositories the project I've worked on my Summer 2024 (freshman summer) internship, which is about training an LSTM model with stock price data, and visualizing. 

** The code for my "Intro to Programming II" course project is available upon request. I can't share it on Github publicly because it is basically answers to a homework that might get asssigned in class again :). 

üìö Related Coursework:
Intro to Programming I (Winter 2024): Taught the basics of python programming including some data structures and with a focus on recursion on the last part. 

Intro to Programming II (Spring 2024): A continuation of the python course that focused on software implementation, where we got to work on a group project implementing a "Blokus" game. I then personally worked on a "bot" part where I developed 3 different bots depending on their playing level. The code for this project is available upon request. 

Linear Algebra (Spring 2024): A computationally focused linear algebra course where I've gained understanding in: matrices, vectors, vector spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Cramer's rule, Gaussian elimination, Gauss‚ÄìJordan elimination, orthogonality, least-squares. 

Systems Programming I (Fall 2024, current): Learning how to program using C. 
Math for Machine Learning: (Directly taken from course description) This course is an introduction to key mathematical concepts at the heart of machine learning. The focus is on matrix methods and statistical models and features real-world applications ranging from classification and clustering to denoising and recommender systems. Mathematical topics covered include linear equations, regression, regularization, the singular value decomposition, iterative optimization algorithms, and probabilistic models. Machine learning topics include classification and regression, overfitting, support vector machines, kernel methods, clustering, neural networks, and deep learning.
